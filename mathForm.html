                <p>Bryce drops a bouncy ball out of a window 30m up from the ground. Coming towards him at a velocity of 7m/s is a truck. How long did it take the ball to drop and, if the bouncy ball lands in the truck, how far away was the truck when the ball was droped? Remember gravity is 9.8m/s&sup2;</p>
