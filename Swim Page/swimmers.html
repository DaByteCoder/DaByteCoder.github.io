                    <h3>Senior</h3>
                    <p>Keith is our fastest swimmer. He is 3 seconds away from the school's 100 back record, and 10 from the 500 free record! Keith can win almost any free or back event you put him in. It will be a massive hit the the team when we lose him.</p>

                    <p>Quinn is very fast for a freshman. He can normaly win the 50, 100, 200 free, and it is kind of a coin toss on who will win the shorter races between him and Keith! He is within 20 seconds of the 500 record.</p>
