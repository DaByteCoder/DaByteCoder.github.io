                <h2>The Bulldog Swimming Club</h2>
                <p>The Piranhas is our swimming club for the younger kids. It is run by <b>Mrs. Lawler</b>, who's family owns the pool. The pool is the home of the swimming bulldogs, and the Piranha's moto is "Every dog has a little fish in 'em". The Piranhas may just be a club,
                    but they see some serious competition! The kiddos who can make qualifying time get to go down to the MTSL Championships, and there they get to see some of the fastest swimmers in the state! Without this club, we problebly wouldn't have enough high school
                    swimmers coming in to have a team! To learn more, go to their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/p/Rudyard-Piranhas-100064626162169/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>
