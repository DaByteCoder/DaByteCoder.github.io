                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>We are in the MHSAA Upper Peninsula league, and we are an overall well rounded team. Our girls team wins most of their meets, and our boys often win their events, but as there are only two boys, they rarely win as they are greatly outnumbered.
                        Both the boys are close to the 500 freestyle record, and one of them is even closer to the 100 backstroke record! Go to the <a href="swimmers.html">Swimmers</a> page for more information. We also have a swimming club with loads of kids, they are the
                        <a href="piranhas.html">Piranhas</a>. We have a few new kids coming to our team next year, but we are also losing three of our seniors, which will be a big hit to the team.
