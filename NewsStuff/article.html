            <h1>Homingcoming is Coming!</h1>
            <h2>The Float Compitition has begun!</h2>
            <p>Each grade can now begin their Homingcoming floats! This year's theme is board games. There are many differant games, from Battleship to Candyland to Clue. They will be shown at halftime during the game. This year is <strong>Pickford vs Rudyard</strong>. They will all be judged by the teachers.</p>
            <h2>The <i>Homecoming Court</i> and games are being chosen.</h2>
            <p>One boy and one girl in each grade will be chosen for <i>Homecoming Court</i>, where in a school event they will compete in multiple differant games. Anyone can be on the court and a vote is held in each grade for the canadates. The games often include things like musical chairs, but they hide the chairs around the gym. Another game is where the canadates have to get people from the beleachers with centain requirements(glasses, grade, eye color, etc). One student said <q>I love the floats so much. I can't wait for the floats.</q>- Eli Folkersma.</p>
            <h2>This Homecoming is going to be a good one.</h2>
            <p>Everyone is syched up for Homecoming and people are already planing their spirit week outfits and making plans for the dance. The Bulldog marching band will be playing at the game (we're amazing) and playing some popular songs such as <cite>I Bet My Life</cite> and <cite>Steal My Girl</cite>. There will be a parade going through town before the football game that will showcase the floats to anyone not going to the game. Student councel will be hosting the dance and everyone is scrambling to find a sweetheart for this dance.</p>
