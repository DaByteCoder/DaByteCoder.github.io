                <h2>Conquest</h2>
                <p style="width: 800px;">The embodiment of domination and ambition, Conquest wields the power to subjugate and control all who stand in his path. With an aura of undeniable authority, he bends the will of others, claiming territories and souls alike. His influence spreads like a shadow, erasing opposition and instilling loyalty &minus; or fear &minus; in those who survive. Conquest is relentless, his victories marked not just by physical domination but by the psychological breaking of his adversaries. His presence signifies the unyielding march of control, leaving a world reshaped in his image, for better or worse.</p>

                <img src="../Photos/war.png" alt="The Horseman of War">
                <h2>War</h2>
                <p style="width: 800px;">The brutal and unstoppable force of chaos and destruction, War thrives on conflict, spreading carnage wherever he goes. With every clash of steel and thunder of battle, he fuels the flames of violence, driving men to slaughter and nations to ruin. His power lies in his ability to incite aggression, turning allies into enemies and peace into bloodshed. War revels in the raw fury of combat, leaving devastation and despair in his wake. Unyielding and merciless, he thrives on the chaos he creates, a grim reminder of the destructive nature of unchecked rage and ambition.</p>

                <h2>Famine</h2>
                <p style="width: 800px;">A haunting and relentless force within the team, Famine wields the devastating power to drain life through starvation and deprivation. Wherever he treads, abundance withers, leaving only desperation and decay in his wake. He forces others to confront the fragility of survival, breaking even the strongest through hunger and need. While his methods are subtle and slow compared to outright conflict, they are no less lethal, as his influence erodes hope and vitality over time. Famine's power lies in his ability to weaken and control through the deprivation of life's most basic necessities, making him a harbinger of despair and ruin.</p>

                <h2>Death</h2>
                <p style="width: 800px;">The inevitable and unrelenting force that spares no one, Death is the silent shadow that follows all living things. With a mere touch, he claims souls, ending lives in an instant or drawing them into slow decline. His presence brings an eerie calm, a chilling certainty that nothing escapes his grasp. Death wields power over the cycle of life, severing the threads of existence and ushering in the unknown. Where he walks, despair and stillness follow, as all must bow to his final judgment. Unstoppable and impartial, Death is the ultimate end, the inescapable truth that no force can defy.</p>
